# A Journey Through Chinese Typography

A personal interest project on the history of Chinese characters, writing and typography across different mediums past and present.

*These drafts had been lying unfinished in my blog's draft folder for YEARS, let's see when I'll finally finish writing them* ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Local development

3. `npm run dev`

- Content goes into *views/posts* folder as markdown, and will be compiled by Eleventy
- Styles go in the styles.scss file, and will be compiled by Gulp
- Scripts go into the js folder, and will be concatenated by Gulp
